# vanilla-text-editor
A simple and lightweight rich text editor created using vanilla javascript, hence the name. Still wip.
This editor is designed to be a lightweight yet powerful ally for forum owners, comment system on blogs etc.
To start with testing and checking it out, just open the text-editor-demo file.
This is my first github repository and I am still learning my way out here. So please bear patience with me. I hope you try and suggest/contribute to the project.
Thank you.
